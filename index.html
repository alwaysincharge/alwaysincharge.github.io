      <p style="font-family: 'Maven Pro',sans-serif ! important; font-size: 17px; width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 30px;">For several years, Elizabeth Odani-Sibanyama has had a heart of uncommon care for children. Owing to her first profession as a teacher she put in her everything to educate children. For her, education has become both a means and an end in itself. Through it a child could be well equipped to become what he or she has set out to become. <br><br>
Over the years, Elizabeth has sponsored 7 children in their education through to the tertiary levels. And today, some of her beneficiaries have become bankers, teachers, etc. <br><br>
In December 2015, she returned home from USA to set up Say Yes for Child Survival Foundation. Her sole aim has been to commit a significant part of her life savings to support needy but brilliant school children to achieve their educational ambitions. <br><br>
According to an Akan proverb, “wo foro dua pa na ye pea wo” meaning “he who pursues a good cause is worthy of support”. So, competent, God fearing professionals threw their weighty support behind her to go on the mission to seek out these 10 kids at Nyagbo-Odumase.<br><br>


Nyagbo-Odumase is a small village in the Volta Region of Ghana close to Hohoe. It is a farming community with a little more than 350 inhabitants. 
The farming here has been mostly subsistent to provide food for families and little to sell. Fortunately, founder Elizabeth was partly brought up in this village. Charity, they say, begins at home. <br><br>
The Nyagbo-Odumase Evangelical Presbyterian (E.P.) Primary school was established in 1912 by a group of German missionaries. The Government of Ghana whilst taking over missionary schools included this too. 
The first batch of Say Yes beneficiaries have been selected from 10 different clans making up the village’s community. All of whom attend this school from Primary 1 – 6 classes.

On several occasions the Lord revealed to me in a dream how I should have compassion for the needy children. I got on my knees and asked the Lord to provide the means to take care of the needy children. In 2002 I got a job in New Jersey in the U.S. and through this job, in 2004 I was able to sponsor seven children who were 8th grade dropout. Every month I sent $400.00 for the education, clothing, food and other things for these children. One sponsored child graduated at the Central University College of Ghana, another one graduated from teachers training college, Hohoe, Ghana and one still in Saint Francis teachers training college, Hohoe, who will graduate next year by the grace of God. <br><br>

In December 2015 I went home in Ghana. While there, I followed through on what the Lord told me about helping the needy children. Say Yes for Child Survival Foundation was founded under my leadership with the help of my husband. Currently we are sponsoring 10 children from a community and deprived public school in the rural area in Ghana. We hope very soon, through our collective efforts, we shall include more communities in rural and urban areas in Ghana. <br><br>

I am very excited that the long awaited dream has come to pass. Please join me in saying big thank you to the Lord."</p>
